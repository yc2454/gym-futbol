# gym-futbol

•	A reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play soccer in a primitive 2D simulator. AI players are trained to play with hard-coded opponents

•	Implemented different reinforcement algorithms for training, such as Deep Q learning, PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)

•	Developed the reinforcement learning environment with OpenAI's gym

Use the colab_notebook to try our environments and trained agents
